                  <h1>How we started</h1>
                  <p>Nistha, Chevanique , Lucero, and Jose, four architectural students, recognized early in 2024 that they were all having trouble with portfolio reviews. They were dissatisfied with the dearth of easily available materials and comments, so they set out to develop a website that would assist other students in improving their portfolios. Using their combined expertise in outreach, coding, and design, they put in many hours to create an approachable platform where students could submit their work and get helpful feedback from industry experts and peers. Following several months of working together, they were able to successfully launch the website in September 2023, which attracted an increasing number of architecture students eager to improve their portfolios and encourage one another on their artistic endeavors. Their initiative not only filled a significant gap in architectural education but also fostered a collaborative spirit among aspiring architects.</p>
